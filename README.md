Machine Learning-Based Brain Tumor Detection System
An advanced Brain Tumor Detection System built using Python, Flask, and Machine Learning. This system analyzes MRI images to detect the presence of brain tumors and provides visual explanations using Grad-CAM heatmaps.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
Tumor Detection: Classifies MRI images as Tumor or No Tumor using a trained model.
Grad-CAM Visualizations: Generates heatmaps to highlight areas contributing to predictions.
Stylish UI: Modern Bootstrap-based interface with animations and responsiveness.
Image Upload: Easily upload MRI images for prediction.
Downloadable Results: Saves predictions and heatmaps for further analysis.
Parameter Tuning: Adjust patch size and stride via the UI for better performance.
